#PS-Backup-Tool

This powershell tool is a full GUI script that allows you to backup a folder of your choosing to a remote or local storage solution using Robocopy.

You can edit the $Script variable in the script to set the desination of your backup. It is currently set up to backup User folders but you can also change that by editting the $Client variable.
